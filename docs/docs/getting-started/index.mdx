Get started with Llama Stack in minutes!

Llama Stack is a stateful service with REST APIs to support the seamless transition of AI applications across different
environments. You can build and test using a local server first and deploy to a hosted endpoint for production.

In this guide, we'll walk through how to build a RAG application locally using Llama Stack with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
as the inference [provider](/docs/providers/inference) for a Llama Model.

**ðŸ’¡ Notebook Version:** You can also follow this quickstart guide in a Jupyter notebook format: [quick_start.ipynb](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack/blob/main/docs/quick_start.ipynb)

#### Step 1: Install and setup
1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. Run inference on a Llama model with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
```bash
ollama run llama3.2:3b --keepalive 60m
```

#### Step 2: Run the Llama Stack server

We will use `uv` to run the Llama Stack server.
```bash
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434 \
  uv run --with llama-stack llama stack build --distro starter --image-type venv --run
```
#### Step 3: Run the demo
Now open up a new terminal and copy the following script into a file named `demo_script.py`.

```python title="demo_script.py"
# Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.
# All rights reserved.

# the root directory of this source tree.

from llama_stack_client import Agent, AgentEventLogger, RAGDocument, LlamaStackClient

vector_db_id = "my_demo_vector_db"
client = LlamaStackClient(base_url="http://localhost:8321")

models = client.models.list()

# Select the first LLM and first embedding models
model_id = next(m for m in models if m.model_type == "llm").identifier
embedding_model_id = (
    em := next(m for m in models if m.model_type == "embedding")
).identifier
embedding_dimension = em.metadata["embedding_dimension"]

vector_db = client.vector_dbs.register(
    vector_db_id=vector_db_id,
    embedding_model=embedding_model_id,
    embedding_dimension=embedding_dimension,
    provider_id="faiss",
)
vector_db_id = vector_db.identifier
source = "https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html"
print("rag_tool> Ingesting document:", source)
document = RAGDocument(
    document_id="document_1",
    content=source,
    mime_type="text/html",
    metadata={},
)
client.tool_runtime.rag_tool.insert(
    documents=[document],
    vector_db_id=vector_db_id,
    chunk_size_in_tokens=100,
)
agent = Agent(
    client,
    model=model_id,
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "builtin::rag/knowledge_search",
            "args": {"vector_db_ids": [vector_db_id]},
        }
    ],
)

prompt = "How do you do great work?"
print("prompt>", prompt)

use_stream = True
response = agent.create_turn(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    session_id=agent.create_session("rag_session"),
    stream=use_stream,
)

# Only call `AgentEventLogger().log(response)` for streaming responses.
if use_stream:
    for log in AgentEventLogger().log(response):
        log.print()
else:
    print(response)
```
We will use `uv` to run the script
```
uv run --with llama-stack-client,fire,requests demo_script.py
```
And you should see output like below.
```
rag_tool> Ingesting document: https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html

inference> Based on the search results, it seems that doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. However, there is no clear threshold for importance, and it can be difficult to judge at the time.

To further clarify, I would suggest that doing great work involves:

* Completing tasks with high quality and attention to detail
* Expanding on existing knowledge or ideas
* Making a positive impact on others through your work
* Striving for excellence and continuous improvement

Ultimately, great work is about making a meaningful contribution and leaving a lasting impression.
