# Starting a Llama Stack Server

You can run a Llama Stack server in one of the following ways:

## As a Library

This is the simplest way to get started. Using Llama Stack as a library means you do not need to start a server. This is especially useful when you are not running inference locally and relying on an external inference service (e.g. fireworks, together, groq, etc.)

**See:** [Using Llama Stack as a Library](./importing-as-library)

## Container

Another simple way to start interacting with Llama Stack is to just spin up a container (via Docker or Podman) which is pre-built with all the providers you need. We provide a number of pre-built images so you can start a Llama Stack server instantly. You can also build your own custom container. Which distribution to choose depends on the hardware you have.

**See:** [Available Distributions](./list-of-distributions) for more details on selecting the right distribution.

## Kubernetes

If you have built a container image and want to deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster instead of starting the Llama Stack server locally.

**See:** [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](/docs/deploying/kubernetes-deployment) for more details.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your deployment method** based on your requirements
2. **Select a distribution** that matches your hardware and needs
3. **Configure your environment** with the appropriate settings
4. **Start your stack** and begin building with Llama Stack APIs
