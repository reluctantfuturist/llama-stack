This is an asynchronous API. If the request is successful, the response will be a job which can be polled for completion.

NOTE: This API is not yet implemented and is subject to change in concert with other asynchronous APIs
including (post-training, evals, etc).



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
